👋 Hi, I’m Elisa Pan  

I’m a computer engineering student with interests in systems, security, and applied machine learning. I enjoy building and analyzing software that supports real-world workflows, from low-level systems to AI-enabled applications.

I’ve worked on projects involving cybersecurity, distributed systems, and ML-based risk assessment, and I’m always curious about how theory translates into practice.
